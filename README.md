# pydistlearn

### A project to provide distributed machine learning

### Uses pyplasma, a python wrapped PLASMA

### Dependencies:
* numpy
* pyplasma
* pyioneer

#### Installation:

* Clone this repo
* Do git submodule init to initialize pyplasma
* setup pyplasma and test run

##### TODO: 
* fix the readme
* scripts to install the whole lib
* setup example for client/server
* preprocessing functionalities on python sklearn
* 	data - normalization (mean = 0 , std - 1)
* 	categotical - numerical
* 	cleaning data (what to do with missing data) - user entry/ mean-median-mode
* 	calculate correlation btwn diff column and datasets (on donor's datatset)
* 	calculating the distribution of each column (statistics for each column)
* 	train/test
* evaluation of models ( method of eval, RMSC root mean square error)

* real world use cases
* predicting the length of stay ( insurance )
* cost of hospitalization
